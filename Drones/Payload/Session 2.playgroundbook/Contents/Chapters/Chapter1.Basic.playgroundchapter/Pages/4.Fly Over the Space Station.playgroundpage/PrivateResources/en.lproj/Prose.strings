**Challenge:** Fly Tello over the Space Station.

You have learned essential Tello commands. And it’s time to start your first challenge. The Space Station needs daily inspections, so we’ll gather information from Tello‘s bottom sensor. This means you need to fly over the Space Station.

You’ll need to use all the commands you‘ve learned, in the right order, to fly over the Space Station.

Don’t worry if you don‘t get it right the first time. This is your chance to experiment and explore.

* Callout(Tips):
  1. Remember to take off first.
  2. Fly forward until you are close to the Space Station, fly up and fly forward to cross the whole length of the station, then fly backward and fly down.
  3. Land at the takeoff position.

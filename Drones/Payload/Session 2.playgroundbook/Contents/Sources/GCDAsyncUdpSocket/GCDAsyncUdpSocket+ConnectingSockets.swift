     * Connects the UDP socket to the given host and port.
     * By design, UDP is a connectionless protocol, and connecting is not needed.
     *
     * Choosing to connect to a specific host/port has the following effect:
     * - You will only be able to send data to the connected host/port.
     * - You will only be able to receive data from the connected host/port.
     * - You will receive ICMP messages that come from the connected host/port, such as "connection refused".
     *
     * The actual process of connecting a UDP socket does not result in any communication on the socket.
     * It simply changes the internal state of the socket.
     *
     * You cannot bind a socket after it has been connected.
     * You can only connect a socket once.
     *
     * The host may be a domain name (e.g. "deusty.com") or an IP address string (e.g. "192.168.0.2").
     *
     * This method is asynchronous as it requires a DNS lookup to resolve the given host name.
     * If an obvious error is detected, this method immediately returns NO and sets errPtr.
     * If you don't care about the error, you can pass nil for errPtr.
     * Otherwise, this method returns YES and begins the asynchronous connection process.
     * The result of the asynchronous connection process will be reported via the delegate methods.

     * then the corresponding delegate method (udpSocket:didConnectToHost:port:) is still invoked.
